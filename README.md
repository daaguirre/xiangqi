Chinese chess in C++
 This is a chinese chess developed in c++. Graphics are made with openGL
 Unfortunatly, the game is not finished yet. The movements of each piece is programmed and 
 if you press on any piece the computer indicated you all possible movements you can do. 
 I have to add the game's dynamics and the identification of the winner.
